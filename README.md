Component Structure

PostsDisplay Component: Displays all the posts by retrieving and showing a list of post items.
CreatePost Component: Includes a form for creating new posts, handling input fields for post details such as title and content.
State Management
The application uses Redux for state management. Redux helps in keeping track of the postsâ€™ data across the application, making it easier to manage and update the state when users create or edit posts.

Form Handling
Form inputs are validated before allowing users to submit.
Feedback is provided for successful or unsuccessful post creation.
API Interaction
If necessary, use fetch to interact with any required backend API to fetch posts. Handle API responses and update the state accordingly.

Editing Posts
The application handles the logic for editing a post, which includes showing the current post's data in the form and saving the changes.
